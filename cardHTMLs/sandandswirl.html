        What is Cultured Marble?
        <br>
        Cultured Marble is a solid-surface product that has the high-end look of marble and other stone products, but is much more durable and easy to
        maintain. It is a 100% grout-free surface and is 100% sealed, making it ideal for bathtub and shower surrounds, as well as walk in showers, 
        bathroom countertops, vanity tops, sinks and more. There is no more worry about mold growing behind your porous bathroom tile.
